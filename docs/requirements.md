Before you start using you will need to have some tools installed.

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)

These tools are required to be installed for a **Terrabutler** to work properly.

## Installing requirements

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)
- [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv#installation)
